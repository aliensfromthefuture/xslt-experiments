## Getting Started

1. Install `serve`, a simple static file web server written in Go using homebrew.

`brew install syntaqx/tap/serve`

2. Run `serve` (just like that, with no command arguments) inside this project directory.

3. Open the localhost URL serve is serving up and look upon the rendered page with wonder.

4. Give yourself a gift of ten minutes of contemplation in awe of everything you see in the source files three.

5. [Seek enlightenment from an Indian guru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W--Yhp0m35A) who DGAF about proper HTML syntax.
